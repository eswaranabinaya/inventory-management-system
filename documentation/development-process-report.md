# Development Process Report

## Project Overview

**Project Chosen**: The Inventory Management System (IMS) was selected to address the needs of modern businesses in tracking, managing, and optimizing their inventory across multiple warehouses. The system supports product management, stock tracking, purchase orders, reporting, and real-time stock alerts, providing a comprehensive solution for inventory control.

**Technology Stack**: The backend is built with Java (Spring Boot 2.7.18), leveraging its robust ecosystem for RESTful API development, security, and data access. The frontend uses React.js (with Vite for fast builds and HMR), styled with Tailwind CSS for rapid, responsive UI development. PostgreSQL serves as the primary database, chosen for its reliability and advanced features. Docker is used for containerization, ensuring consistent deployments. Railway is the cloud platform for backend and database hosting, while Vercel is used for seamless frontend deployment. This stack was selected for its scalability, developer productivity, and strong community support.

**Development Timeline**: The project was executed in several phases:
- **Planning & Setup (2-3 hours)**: Requirements gathering, tech stack selection, and initial project scaffolding.
- **Backend API & Database (4-5 hours)**: Designing the database schema, implementing REST APIs, and integrating with PostgreSQL.
- **Frontend UI (4-5 hours)**: Building reusable React components, implementing forms, and integrating with backend APIs.
- **Integration & Testing (2-3 hours)**: End-to-end testing, bug fixing, and validation of business logic.
- **Deployment & Debugging (2-3 hours)**: Containerization, cloud deployment, environment configuration, and production debugging.

## AI Tool Usage Summary

**Cursor**: Cursor was instrumental in navigating the codebase, understanding dependencies, and performing large-scale refactoring. Its context-aware suggestions accelerated code reviews and helped maintain clean architecture. For example, Cursor quickly identified all service files needing API base URL updates during the frontend-backend integration phase. Effectiveness rating: 9/10.

**GitHub Copilot**: Copilot was used primarily for generating boilerplate code, such as DTOs, repository interfaces, and React hooks. It also assisted in writing repetitive form validation logic and CRUD operations. Approximately 40% of the codebase, especially in the service and component layers, was generated or templated with Copilot, significantly reducing manual effort.

**AWS Q Developer**: AWS Q Developer was leveraged for security scanning and optimization suggestions. It flagged potential issues in Dockerfiles (e.g., unnecessary layers, missing health checks) and recommended best practices for environment variable management. Its feedback led to improvements in container security and deployment reliability.

## Architecture Decisions

**Database Design**: The schema was normalized to reduce redundancy and ensure data integrity, with foreign keys linking products, warehouses, and inventory records. Indexes were added to optimize query performance for frequent lookups. AI tools suggested improvements in migration scripts (e.g., Flyway versioning) and naming conventions, ensuring maintainability and clarity.

**API Architecture**: A RESTful API design was adopted, exposing clear, resource-based endpoints (e.g., `/api/products`, `/api/inventory`). The controller-service-repository pattern was enforced for separation of concerns. AI guidance helped structure DTOs for request/response validation and recommended best practices for exception handling, pagination, and security (JWT, CORS).

**Frontend Architecture**: The frontend was organized into modular React components, with hooks for data fetching and state management. Tailwind CSS enabled rapid prototyping and consistent styling. AI tools assisted in designing reusable form components and aligning the edit/create page layouts. State was managed locally with React hooks, and API services were abstracted for maintainability.

## Challenges & Solutions

**Technical Challenges**: Several issues arose during development and deployment. For example, Spring Boot Actuator's metrics caused NullPointerExceptions in containerized environments due to missing system resources. This was resolved by disabling specific Micrometer binders and excluding problematic auto-configurations, as suggested by AI analysis. CORS and environment variable misconfigurations led to frontend-backend integration failures, which were debugged and fixed with AI-assisted troubleshooting. Vercel's SPA routing required a custom rewrite rule to prevent 404 errors on direct navigation, a solution provided by AI.

**AI Limitations**: While AI tools were invaluable, they sometimes suggested deprecated or suboptimal patterns, especially in Spring Security configuration. In complex debugging scenarios (e.g., Railway JVM memory tuning, multi-stage Docker builds), manual intervention and domain expertise were required to supplement AI recommendations. Some deployment edge cases, such as environment variable quoting issues on Railway, were not detected by AI and needed hands-on troubleshooting.

**Breakthrough Moments**: The most impactful AI assistance included the rapid identification and resolution of JVM memory issues in Docker, which eliminated backend crashes on Railway. Another breakthrough was the automated refactoring of all frontend service files to use environment-based API URLs, instantly resolving integration bugs across multiple pages. These moments demonstrated the power of AI in accelerating development and ensuring production readiness.
